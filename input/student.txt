A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil "proto-frog" appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforests. There are over 6,300 recorded species, accounting for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.
Early, whose anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes—are less often referred to as "human" than hominins of the genus Homo.[5] Several of these hominins used fire, occupied much of Eurasia, and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago, with the earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing (also in Africa) around 300,000 years ago.[6] The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud, Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago.[7][8][9][10][11] As of 2017, the oldest known skeleton of an anatomically modern Homo sapiens is the Omo-Kibish I, which dates to about 196,000 years ago. It was discovered in southern Ethiopia in 1967.[12][13][14] Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000–70,000 years ago[15][16][17][18][19][20] and (according to recent evidence) as far back as around 300,000 years ago, in the Middle Stone Age,[21][22][23] with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning 
earlier, and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens. In several waves of migration, H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.[24][25]
